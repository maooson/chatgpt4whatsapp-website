If you want AI help while chatting, this guide shows the fastest way to run Agent for WhatsApp.

You will finish three things:
1. Install the extension
2. Connect your AI source
3. Send your first assisted reply

If you want feature limits first, check the [pricing page](/pricing).

## Step 1: Install the Extension

- Open the Chrome Web Store listing.
- Click **Add to Chrome**.
- Pin the extension for quick access.

After install, keep one WhatsApp Web tab open so the extension can initialize correctly.

## Step 2: Open WhatsApp Web and Sign In

- Go to [web.whatsapp.com](https://web.whatsapp.com/)
- Sign in using your phone QR code
- Wait until chats fully load before testing commands

If you test too early, message hooks may fail and look like a product bug.

## Step 3: Connect Your AI Source

Inside extension settings, choose your preferred source:

- ChatGPT Web login mode
- API mode (for users who want more control)

For API mode, verify your key and billing status in your provider dashboard first.

## Step 4: Send Your First Assisted Reply

Try these starter commands in a private chat:

- `@gpt rewrite this politely`
- `@gpt summarize in 1 sentence`
- `@gpt translate to Spanish`

In group chats, mention the bot name first, then your instruction.

## Common Setup Problems

### No response after sending command

- Refresh WhatsApp Web
- Check extension is enabled
- Confirm your AI session is still active

### Authentication error

- Re-login the selected AI source
- Recheck API key format
- Confirm account permissions

For a full troubleshooting matrix, use the [error code guide](/blog/error-list).

## Best Practices for Daily Use

- Keep prompts short and specific
- Set a default response style for consistency
- Use rewrite/translate prompts for the highest productivity gain

If your team uses this heavily, compare higher tiers in [Pricing](/pricing).
